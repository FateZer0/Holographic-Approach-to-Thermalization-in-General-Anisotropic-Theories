# Holographic Approach to Thermalization in General Anisotropic Theories
In our [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP03(2021)164), We employ the holographic approach to study the thermalization in the quenched strongly-coupled field theories with very general anisotropic scalings including Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating fixed points. Here, we provide some numerical verifications for the analytical results.
